# Github Users Query - DigitalCrafts

**Part 1**
Using React, I created a search feature using a controlled input to add users to a list that is displayed. I used the github api to pull in user pictures and names and display them as they are added.

**Part 2**
From the list of users that were created in step one, create routes to enable a user to click on one of the users. Using react router, the user would be displayed a detailed list of that user and a list of their repos would be displayed using the repo api.
